# 🎮 JS Chess
A simple chess game built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, allowing you to move chess pieces on a board with drag-and-drop and valid-move checks.

## 🛠️ Technology
- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `SVG`

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive chessboard layout** - an 8×8 board rendered dynamically using HTML and CSS
- **Drag-and-drop movement** - move any chess piece by dragging and dropping on a valid square
- **Valid-move checking** - each piece’s move is validated according to chess rules (within the implementation)
- **Turn management** - enforces alternating turns between two players (Opponent is not AI)
- **Full standard set of chess pieces** - King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn are all implemented

## 🧠 The Process
I built JS Chess to get hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop events, and implementing game logic directly in JavaScript. The idea was to create a playable chessboard from scratch using web basics. The board was defined using HTML/CSS. I used SVGs for piece graphics. Coded the logic for move validation and turn tracking manually. This approach helped me better understand how interactions, state management and user input handling work in a web context.

Because I wanted the project to be lightweight and easy to test, I avoided build tools or complex dependencies and as such, everything runs in a browser. The structure stays simple: 
- `HTML` - layout
- `CSS` - visuals
- `JavaScript` - logic

## 📦 Running the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser (copy path and paste it in the browser)
3. The game loads automatically there will not be additional setup required
4. Start playing: drag pieces to move them, follow the rules, and enjoy
